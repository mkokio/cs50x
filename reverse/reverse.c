// read in the third TODO in addition to what it returns while the audio data is being read.

// may need to be moved back two block sizes after each fread, one to move back to where
// the fread began, and the second to move to the previous, unread block.

// use fgetc to read the character at that position. After that, you'll want to

// we calculate the size of each block with the following calculation:
// number of channels multiplied by bytes per sample. Luckily, the header
// contains all the information we need to compute these values.
// Be sure to reference the Background section for a more in-depth explanation
// as to what these values mean and how they are stored. See too wav.h, to determine which members of WAVHEADER might be useful.
// Notice that one of the members of WAVHEADER is bitsPerSample. But to calculate block size, youâ€™ll need bytes per sample!
